\section{Considered Solutions}
\subsection{Kleene Meets Church}
At first we wanted to implement scan\_for\_matches' functionality in the 
KMC engine, as our project synopsis states. This was because we had heard of 
how fast the KMC engine is, so it seemed like the logical engine to use. 
However we turned to other solutions when we found out that 
KMC is intended only for text-markup, meaning it doesn't return the position 
of a match. 

\subsection{TRE}
A regex engine that we considered for our implementation of scan\_for\_matches 
was TRE. TRE is an open-source engine implemented in C by Ville Laurikari for 
his master's thesis in 2001 with the goal to implement approximate matching in 
regex. By using a mix of Levenshtein distancing (which describes 
approximate matching) and tagged NFAs (tNFA), Laurikari accomplished this with a 
linear complexity of O(MN), where M is the size of a regular expression and N is the 
size of the input string\cite{LaurikariComplex}, which means that it maintains the 
regex standard complexity even with approximate matching. \\
While this is impressive, a few problems with the implementation meant that we 
had to look for another solution. The first problem we found with TRE was that 
it used the POSIX.2 regex standard. This means that TRE does not support the 
global pattern modifier, so TRE would only return the earliest best-matching 
match per delimiter\cite{Best-Match}. This combined with another problem we found 
- TRE is unable to match a string which spans over a delimiter - meant that 
TRE would require modification for it to work how we wanted it to. Given our 
limited time as well as the insufficient documentation in the code meant that 
we had to look for another solution.
