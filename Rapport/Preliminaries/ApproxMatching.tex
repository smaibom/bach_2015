 \subsection{Matching}
  \subsubsection{Pattern Matching}
   Matching is when a part of a text is identified correctly as following some 
   rule, defined by the user, and is returned to the user. 
   There are different kinds of matching, for example literal matching where the 
   user wants to find an exact word or sentence. Pattern matching is when we define 
   a pattern as the rule that we want to match with. Since regular expressions %<========== Must check to see if defined previously
   (regex) defines possible patterns, we can use regular expressions as our pattern rule.

  \subsubsection{Approximate Matching}
   For our implementation, we will need to implement 
   approximate matching. Approximate matching is similar to pattern matching, 
   however approximate matching allows errors in the searched text. 
   \begin{mydef}
    An error is when an encountered character in a string is different from 
    what is expected. An error can manifest itself in three different ways:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item A mismatch, where a character is transformed into a different character
    \item A deletion, where a character is missing, and
    \item An insertion, where a random character has been inserted in the text
    \end{enumerate}
   \end{mydef}
   
   While it is possible to perform approximate matching with regular expressions, it is not 
   a computationally efficient thing to do unless it is done on a regex-engine 
   that natively supports approximate matching. This is because the complexity 
   and size of a regular expression increases dramatically when mismatches and 
   insertions are hardcoded for regex, as shown by example \ref{exInsert}
   \begin{myex}\label{exInsert}
   Let {\tt ABCD} be a pattern that we wish to search a text for, where we 
   allow for one insertion. Then the resulting regular expression will be \\
   \begin{center}
   {\tt .ABCD$|$A.BCD$|$AB.CD$|$ABC.D$|$ABCD.$|$ABCD}
   \end{center}
   \end{myex}
   Allowing one insertion in our 4-character text results in six possible 
   permutations that must be accounted for, and the blowup of the regular 
   expression's size only increases as we try to match longer strings with more 
   insertions.
