 \subsection{RE2} %Google's RE engine
 RE2 is Google's regular expression engine written in C++. It supports 
 backtracking, but not backreferencing since backreferencing can't be implemented 
 efficiently according to~\cite{web6}. Since RE2 doesn't support matching with 
 errors or backreferencing, it would be unable to properly reproduce 
 scan\_for\_matches' functionality.
 
 \subsection{TRE} %Got both backtracking and backreferencing
 TRE was created by Ville Laurikari for his master's thesis in 2001, and 
 is a regular expression engine supporting backtracking, backreferencing and 
 matching with errors. Because of this, TRE is the best candidate for modification 
 in order to make it work with patterns. We expand on this in section~\ref{tre}.
