\section{State-of-the-Art}
This section details the current tools readily available that closest match 
what our project aims to do, as well as to see if there are any existing tools 
we can use for our project. For this we will talk about RE2/J, Google's regular 
expression library because of how it handles alternations as well as its 
linear running time, and TRE, which allows errors in its results, can 
simulate backtracking, and supports backreferencing.
 \subsection{RE2/J} %Google's RE engine
 RE2/J is Google's regular expression library written for java. It does not support 
 backtracking or backreferencing since neither can be implemented 
 efficiently. Since RE2/J doesn't support matching with 
 errors or backreferencing, it would be unable to properly reproduce 
 scan\_for\_matches' functionality. The project can be found on its github 
 page\footnote{\url{https://github.com/google/re2j}}.
 \subsection{TRE} %Got both backtracking and backreferencing
 TRE was created by Ville Laurikari for his master's thesis in 2001, and 
 is a regular expression engine which can simulate backtracking and supports 
 backreferencing and matching with errors. Because of this, TRE is the best 
 candidate for modification in order to make it work with patterns. 
 We expand on this in section~\ref{tre}.
