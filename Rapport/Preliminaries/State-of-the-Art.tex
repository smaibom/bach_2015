\section{State-of-the-Art}
The current tools readily available that provides scan\_for\_matches like functionality are RE2/J, Google's regular 
expression library because of how it handles alternations as well as its 
linear running time, and TRE, which allows errors in its results, can 
simulate backtracking, and supports backreferencing.
 \subsection{RE2/J} %Google's RE engine
 RE2/J is Google's regular expression library written for Java. It does not support 
 backtracking or backreferencing since neither can be implemented 
 efficient. Due to RE2/J's restrictions and the lack of support for matching with errors, it would be unable to properly reproduce 
 scan\_for\_matches' functionality. The project can be found on its github 
 page\footnote{\url{https://github.com/google/re2j}}.
 \subsection{TRE} %Got both backtracking and backreferencing
 TRE was created by Ville Laurikari for his master's thesis in 2001\cite{LaurikariComplex}, and 
 is a regular expression engine which can simulate backtracking and supports 
 backreferencing and matching with errors. Because of this, TRE is the best 
 candidate for modification in order to simulate scan\_for\_matches functionality. 
 We expand on this in Section~\ref{tre}.
