\section{Summary \& Future Work}
We presented an alternative type of NFA based on Ville Laurikari's Tagged NFA.
The extensions allow for insertions, deletions and alterations when matching a pattern.
A runtime analysis showed that the new NFA type caused an increase in states which would grow as the mismatches were increased.
Future work would consist of preventing said growth, by removing equivalent states from the stateset and extend the TNFA to support more scan\_for\_matches features, and backreferencing. 

Furthermore research into preprocessing data using suffix trees\cite{Algorithmonstring} could allow possible decrease in runtime due to faster lookup in the data.
