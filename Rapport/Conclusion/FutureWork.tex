\section{Summary \& Future Work}
We presented an alternative type of NFA in Section \ref{section_TNFA}.
The alternation allowed for insertions, deletions and mutations when matching a pattern.
A runtime analysis showed that the new NFA type caused an increase in states which would grow as the errors were increased.
Future work would consist of preventing said growth, by making sure states which does repeated work are handled as a single state. 
Further work would extent on the TNFA to support more SFM features, and backreferenceing. 

Further more a research into preproccesing using suffix trees\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree}} could allow posible decrease in runtime.
