\section{Problem Analysis}\label{probanal}
%INTRODUCTION TO PROBLEM ANALYSIS
The functionality of scan\_for\_matches dictates what our solution must be able 
to do. While a more indepth analysis of the functionality 
of scan\_for\_matches can be found in Section~\ref{scanformatches}, 
the requirements for our solution are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Read a data file
\item Match
\begin{enumerate}
\item with mismatches allowed
\item a previously found match
\item a modified pattern
\end{enumerate}
\item Return matches with their position
\end{enumerate}
While some of the functionality (items 1 and 3) will be trivial to implement 
since they are standard functions of most programming languages, there are 
some challenges to be found in regards of what we must match. Matching with 
mismatches allowed are not supported natively in regular expressions, and 
matching a modified text, which may first be determined at runtime, will be 
challenging to implement with automata.
