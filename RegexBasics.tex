\section{Regular Expression}
A regular expression (regex) is an automata-based way of searching through text, 
and is designed to be able to search for a string with variations to spelling. 
Regex' functionality covers repetitions, wildcards, submatching and more. In 
its purest form, a regular expression is expressed as the following: 
$$E ::= \alpha | \epsilon | E_1 + E_2 | E_1E_2 | E_1*$$
Where $\alpha$ is an alphabet of characters and $\epsilon$ is the empty string.

\subsection{Kleene Star}
The Kleene star (*) defines repetitive matching. It matches zero 
or more occurrences of an expression in a string, and can be described as follows;
$$A* = \bigcup \{\epsilon\}\cup A_1\cup A_2\cup ...$$
where $\epsilon$ is the empty character. Something to note is that in regex you 
can only define an unlimited amount of repetitions, meaning it is impossible to 
set a maximum amount of repetitions using Kleene star.
